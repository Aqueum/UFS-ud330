# Unmaintained

This was a course project, it is not in use and is not maintained, as such vulnnerable dependency alerts have been disabled.  This code should therefore be considered unsafe for use without dependency updates and general code review.

# ud330

This repository contains the code used in the Udacity course Full-Stack Foundations. This code is intended to be a supplement to the course material and runs in the vagrant environment provided in the course. Please report any errors in the code or feel free to make a pull request and I will get to the issue as soon as possible.
